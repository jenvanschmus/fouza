        <p>For the beginning of my adult life I was determined and excited to become an architect and interior designer. While going to college and pursuing this goal, I began taking silver smithing classes as a part of my art requirement. I finished college and started my designing career but discovered I was spending a lot of time making things for myself and gifts for others. After quite a few years of trying to live two lives, I determined that the small intricate fascinating world of silver and gold smithing was my stronger passion. I began training in earnest both with professional schooling and master goldsmiths. I've been doing it now for over 20 years and I still love it. There are always new challenges to tackle, wonderful people to meet, problems to solve, and itsy bitsy details to work out.

If you have any questions from what you see here, or if you'd like to order something special for yourself or a loved one, please feel free to contact me. I also have an Etsy Store, where you can find many things to tickle your fancy.
